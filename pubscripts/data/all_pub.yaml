        of Transformer-based Large Language Models, achieved through learning.
        In this position/theory paper, we propose a paradigm shift by designing
        an architecture to memorize text directly, bearing in mind the principle
        that memorization precedes learning. We introduce MeMo, a novel architecture
        for language modeling that explicitly memorizes sequences of tokens
        in layered associative memories. By design, MeMo offers transparency
        and the possibility of model editing, including forgetting texts.
        We experimented with the MeMo architecture, showing the memorization
        power of the one-layer and the multi-layer configurations.', address: 'Vienna,

        Identifiable Information (PII), which should not be stored and, consequently,

        (PME), an approach for preventing private data leakage that turns
        an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'' memorization ability,
        into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks against LLMs
        have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
        training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge
        in order to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and
        then mitigate the memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge
        of its training data. We verify that our procedure does not affect
        the underlying language model while making it more robust against
        privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We demonstrate that PME

        Chain-of-Thought (CoT), empower the reasoning abilities of Large Language
        Models (LLMs) by eliciting them to solve complex tasks in a step-by-step
        manner. Although they are achieving significant success, the ability
        to deliver multi-step reasoning remains limited to English because

        CoT reasoning across languages. The proposed method, through a self-consistent
        cross-lingual prompting mechanism inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts
        approach, provides multi-step reasoning paths in different languages

        languages to observe how their respective monolingual models encode
        structural information. We aim to layer-wise compare transformers
        for typologically similar languages to observe whether these similarities
        emerge for particular layers. For this investigation, we propose to
        use Centered Kernel Alignment to measure similarity among weight matrices.
        We found that syntactic typological similarity is consistent with
        the similarity between the weights in the middle layers, which are
        the pretrained BERT layers to which syntax encoding is generally attributed.
